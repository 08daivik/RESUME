<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
In childhood, we spend a lot of time playing, exploring and developing, but as we become older, responsibilities, chores, and professions take over our lives.
I believe hobbies are a source of ability, interest, and efficiency that allows us to fully develop different sides of our personalities. 
My hobbies are
<ul>
    <h3>    <li>Hiking</li><br />
    <li>Travelling</li><br />
    <li>Badminton</li><br />
    <li>Gardening</li><br />
    <li>Painting</li><br />
</h3>

</ul>
